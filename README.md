# Pre-GPT4 photo analyzer (FastAPI endpoint)

Long time ago, before GPT-4 has learned to analyze photos, we used endpoints such as this one to make our bot respond to users' photos. 
Hopefully, humanity will not degrade into using this repository, but nevertheless it's a nice piece of thought!

To check the endpoint:

1. Run containers via ```docker-compose up```.
2. Send request using ```test-requests.http``` file.
